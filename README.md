# ChatGPT

## Overview
- ChatGPT is a specific type of `machine learning model` that has been trained on a massive amount of text data, in order to be able to generate human-like responses to text-based inputs.
- ChatGPT uses a technique called `unsupervised learning`, meaning that it can learn patterns and relationships in the data without being explicitly told what to look for.
- ChatGPT `Large language models(LLM)` is typically based on `deep learning algorithms` where model is trained to understand and generate natural language .It require a significant amount of computing power and data to be trained effectively. Example Google's BERT, and Facebook's RoBERTa, OpenAI GPT series (such as GPT-3/4).
